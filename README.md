Hi, im some 13yr old who started programming at the age of 10, quit, then got interested in it again 2 years ago. I dont have a programming job, but, i do it for fun, to test my skills and prepare my self for the future. 
  My dream is to work at big tech company by the time i can work, then, to become an entrepreneur and be a positive influence on people around me. My role model is Bill Gates.
Im basically a noob at this, but the more mature and self conscious i become, the easier for me it is. Thank you, and, bread 🍞👍.
